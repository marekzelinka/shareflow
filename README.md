## Reflection

This was a 2-week long project built for my portfolio. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) and [supabase](https://supabase.io/).

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to create/join a room, share the URL with other individuals, and collaborate by sharing useful links and snippets!

One of the main challenges I ran into was working with a SQL-based database like [supabase](https://supabase.io/), previously I worked with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). This led me to spend a few days on a research spike into SQL, and database design with PostgreSQL.
